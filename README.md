## Hi, I'm Connor! 👋

I'm a **Data Scientist** based in London (originally from South Wales).

My background is in Physics, but since graduating I've been working as a Data Science and Machine Learning Consultant.

This GitHub consists of projects I do in my free time – mostly machine learning projects and Kaggle competition entries, but I enjoy occasionally building web applications or Python packages.

### 💻 Languages & Tools

* **Data Science:** Python, SQL, R
* **Web Development:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
